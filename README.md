# BlackJack-Game

•	This is an intermediate level project where a user has to Hit the hit button to generate a random card from given selected cards along with that the score is been calculated and if the score reaches a maximum score ie 30 it will get burst.
•	Then the user has to click the Stand button to check whether his score is greater than the computer score or not. if yes then it will display your won else you lose or draw.
•	The most interesting part is that we can tally the gameplay in the table below our gameplay area that how many wins, loses, and draws are being happened. Along with that if the user wins the game the sound is produced the same, if the user losses the game.
•	The Deal button’s function is to compare user and computer scores to tell who else wins or loses.
